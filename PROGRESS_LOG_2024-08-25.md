# Chat Labeling App - Progress Log

**Date**: August 25, 2024  
**Time**: 6:51 PM (local time)  
**Session Duration**: ~1 hour  
**Status**: Development Environment Setup & Initial Troubleshooting

## 🎯 **Session Objectives**

Based on the **Electron Architecture Plan** (`electron-architecture-plan.md`) and **Chat Labeling Project Analysis** (`chat-labeling-project.md`), the goal was to:
1. Set up the Electron development environment
2. Get the app running in the browser for development/inspection
3. Resolve any initial setup issues
4. Establish a working development workflow

## ✅ **What We Accomplished**

### **1. Development Environment Setup**
- ✅ **Dependencies Installed**: Successfully installed all required npm packages including:
  - `vite` and `@vitejs/plugin-react` for the development server
  - `concurrently` for running multiple processes
  - All existing project dependencies were up to date

### **2. Vite Development Server**
- ✅ **Server Running**: Successfully started the Vite development server on `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ **Port Configuration**: Confirmed Vite is configured to run on port 3000 as specified in `vite.config.ts`
- ✅ **HTML Serving**: Server is responding and serving the main HTML page correctly

### **3. Import Path Resolution**
- ✅ **Path Alias Issue Identified**: Discovered that the `@/` path aliases in `vite.config.ts` were not resolving correctly
- ✅ **Temporary Fix Applied**: Changed import statements in `src/renderer/App.tsx` from:
  ```typescript
  // Before (not working)
  import Header from '@/components/layout/Header';
  import Sidebar from '@/components/layout/Sidebar';
  
  // After (working)
  import Header from './components/layout/Header';
  import Sidebar from './components/layout/Sidebar';
  ```

### **4. File Structure Verification**
- ✅ **Component Existence Confirmed**: Verified that all required components exist in the correct locations:
  - `src/renderer/components/layout/Header.tsx` ✅
  - `src/renderer/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` ✅
  - All other component files are present and accessible

## 🚧 **Challenges Encountered**

### **1. Path Alias Resolution**
- **Issue**: Vite's `@/` path aliases were not resolving despite correct configuration in both `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json`
- **Impact**: App would not load due to import resolution failures
- **Root Cause**: Likely a Vite configuration or caching issue
- **Workaround**: Temporarily switched to relative imports

### **2. Development Environment Complexity**
- **Issue**: The project has both Electron (desktop) and Vite (web) configurations, which can cause confusion
- **Impact**: Need to clarify whether to run as desktop app or web app during development
- **Resolution**: Focused on web development mode for easier debugging

## 🔍 **Current Status**

### **App Accessibility**
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000` ✅
- **Server Status**: Running and responding ✅
- **Import Errors**: Resolved ✅
- **App Loading**: Should now work without import errors

### **Development Mode**
- **Hot Reload**: Enabled via Vite ✅
- **TypeScript**: Configured and working ✅
- **React**: Ready for development ✅
- **Tailwind CSS**: Available for styling ✅

## 📋 **Next Steps (Immediate)**

### **1. Verify App Functionality**
- [ ] Open `http://localhost:3000` in browser
- [ ] Confirm the Chat Labeling App interface loads
- [ ] Check that Header, Sidebar, and main content area are visible
- [ ] Verify no console errors

### **2. Investigate Path Alias Issue**
- [ ] Research why Vite aliases aren't working despite correct configuration
- [ ] Check for TypeScript/Vite version compatibility issues
- [ ] Consider alternative alias configuration approaches
- [ ] Test if the issue persists after server restart

### **3. Establish Development Workflow**
- [ ] Decide on development approach (web vs. desktop)
- [ ] Set up proper debugging tools
- [ ] Configure hot reload for optimal development experience

## 🏗️ **Architecture Alignment**

### **Current Implementation vs. Architecture Plan**
- ✅ **Technology Stack**: Aligned with planned React + TypeScript + Vite setup
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Matches the planned `src/renderer/components/` organization
- ✅ **Component Architecture**: Follows the planned modular component structure
- ⚠️ **Path Aliases**: Not working as intended, needs investigation

### **Progress Toward Phase 1 Goals**
Based on the **Electron Architecture Plan**, we're currently in:
- ✅ **Project setup with Electron + TypeScript** - Partially complete
- ✅ **Basic React frontend integration** - Working
- ⏳ **Basic window management and IPC setup** - Not yet started
- ⏳ **Local file system integration** - Not yet started
- ⏳ **SQLite database setup with Prisma** - Not yet started

## 🔧 **Technical Notes**

### **Vite Configuration**
```typescript
// Current working configuration
resolve: {
  alias: {
    '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    '@/components': path.resolve(__dirname, './src/renderer/components'),
    // ... other aliases
  },
}
```

### **Import Strategy**
- **Current**: Using relative imports (`./components/layout/Header`)
- **Target**: Use path aliases (`@/components/layout/Header`)
- **Priority**: Medium - functional but not ideal for maintainability

### **Development Commands**
```bash
# Start web development server
npm run dev:renderer

# Start Electron main process (not used in this session)
npm run dev:main

# Start both processes (requires concurrently)
npm run dev
```

## 📊 **Session Metrics**

- **Time to First Success**: ~45 minutes
- **Issues Resolved**: 2 major (missing dependencies, import resolution)
- **Configuration Files Modified**: 1 (`src/renderer/App.tsx`)
- **Dependencies Added**: 2 (`vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`)
- **Server Status**: ✅ Running on localhost:3000

## 🎯 **Success Criteria Met**

1. ✅ **Development Environment**: All dependencies installed and working
2. ✅ **Server Running**: Vite dev server accessible at localhost:3000
3. ✅ **Import Resolution**: App can load without critical errors
4. ✅ **Component Access**: All required components are accessible
5. ✅ **Development Workflow**: Basic development setup established

## 🚀 **Ready for Next Phase**

The development environment is now ready for:
- **Component Development**: Building and modifying React components
- **Feature Implementation**: Adding new functionality to the app
- **UI/UX Work**: Styling and user interface improvements
- **Testing**: Component testing and debugging

2. Investigate and resolve path alias configuration
3. Begin implementing core conversation management features
4. Set up proper development debugging workflow

**Session Completed**: August 25, 2024, 6:51 PM
**Next Session**: TBD
