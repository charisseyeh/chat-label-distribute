Also, what does stress feel like for you physically and emotionally?"

This is actually very common and manageable.\n\nLet me suggest some immediate strategies:\n\n1. **Breathing exercises** - Try 4-7-8 breathing: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8\n2. **Physical activity** - Even a 10-minute walk can help reduce stress hormones\n3. **Time management** - Break your work into smaller, manageable tasks\n4. **Boundaries** - Set clear work hours and stick to them\n\nWould you like to try one of these techniques now, or do you have questions about any of them?"

Find a comfortable position and:\n\n1. **Inhale slowly** through your nose for 4 counts (1-2-3-4)\n2. **Hold** the breath for 7 counts (1-2-3-4-5-6-7)\n3. **Exhale slowly** through your mouth for 8 counts (1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8)\n4. **Repeat** this cycle 3-4 times\n\nFocus on the counting and the sensation of your breath. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the counting.\n\nHow does that feel? You should notice your heart rate slowing and muscles relaxing after a few cycles."
